    Hi! I'm Dan ðŸ‘‹

    I am a highly motivated volunteer community manager & full-time customer support guru, looking to move from the typical IT office, to a more community and social focused role in the gaming community.

    I spend the majority of my free time volunteering as a community manager for online gaming communities, 
    running fun events and tournaments and striving to assist every gamer I come across in giving them answers to their problems and giving them a bigger voice to let their feedback (good and bad) be heard - predominantly on Reddit, Twitter and Discord.

    So if you're looking for someone to help manage your community, speak to gamers on a gamer level and collect all the best (and worst) feedback, and don't mind the odd awful joke - my DMs are open!

    This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

    Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
