      At PUBG Reddit, after being a member of the community I was invited to be part
      of the moderation team.
      This mostly involves ensuring rules are abided to by our 100k+ members and assisting with
      any issues and conflicts between members.
      
      Working closely with the rest of the team, I help plan ways to assist the community in getting it's 
      voice across to the games developers. Coming up with topics of discussion on Reddit and Twitter and 
      providing ways for feedback to be shared with PUBG Corp directly, whilst also ensuring the conversation
      is kept constructive.   

      I am also in charge of hosting our Community Custom Games where we run a leaderboard
      and fun tournaments with fun and specific modes made up by ourselves and the players.
      All games are streamed live on Twitch and I, along with others, cast these games as they
      are being played out to provide a fun experience to the players and the community watching.

      I also work closely with PUBG Corp staff with any requirements they may have with the subreddit,
      working together on fun community events and giveaways as well as providing any feedback and bugs 
      in the game itself for PUBG Corp to investigate and improve on.

      As part of this, I also manage the PUBG Reddit Twitter account, ensuring relevant content is shared 
      and posted in relation to the game and providing talking points to drive the conversation further.
