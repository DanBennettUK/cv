    - I am currently working for HowToMoodle where my main role title is "Support Technician", since April 2012.
    - I am one of three main points of contact for setting up customers Moodle sites, upgrading the version of the application, as well as maintaining ongoing support with the client with any issues they may have whilst using the service.<br/>
      I am also one of two main points of contact for providing support to External Clients who host their own service, or use third-party hosting services.<br/>
      We have clients all over the UK and the world and managing expectations of the services we provide and managing customer happiness is key to my role.<br/><br/>
    - Outside of work, I am a keen music producer in my spare time with support from BBC Introducing. I am also an avid radio presenter/producer who volunteered for a local community station for two years specialising in shows for new, up & coming music and dance music.<br/><br/>
